                        Hi, Iâ€™m Stavros Makrygiannis â€” a Frontend Developer driven by curiosity and creativity. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, responsive, and engaging web experiences that people actually enjoy using. What started as an interest quickly became a passion, and I've been learning, building, and experimenting ever since.
                        <br /><br />
                        Iâ€™ve recently completed my military service and Iâ€™m now finalizing my thesis for my integrated bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s degree in Informatics and Computer Engineering at the University of West Attica. 
                        Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked on personal,academic and professional projects that helped me sharpen my frontend skills and discover how much I enjoy the process of solving real-world problems through code.
                        <br /><br />
                        I'm always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful projects â€” and this portfolio is a glimpse into that journey.
                        <br /><br />
                        <span>Feel free to explore my portfolio and see what Iâ€™ve been working on!</span>
