Throughout creating UnQ, I've learned and utilized various techniques and features that React offers. I will mention some of the most significant ones. I learned about React's reusability concept which allowed me to create components that could be easily repurposed, ensuring a consistent and efficient user interface.Also learned using built-in hooks and create custom hooks. After that, I learned how to implement a caching mechanism to store data consistently. Lastly, I can't overlook to mention one of the most valuable lessons I learned was the importance of responsive design. By harnessing the power of media queries and flexible layout techniques, UnQ now provides an optimal user experience on all devices, from large desktop screens to smaller smartphones. No matter where customers are browsing from, they can seamlessly access and interact with the site, ensuring maximum engagement and satisfaction. I'm excited to have acquired new knowledge and skills, further fueling my passion for web development. üî• üî•",
